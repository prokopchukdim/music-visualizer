# music-visualizer

A web app that can visualize music files. Created as a personal learning project using Java, Springboot, React.js, p5.js, Docker, Azure, and Netlify.

Supports drag-and-drop for your own music files. Can also upload your files to the server and download/delete existing files. Some of the existing files are protected so they can't be deleted or overwritten. 

The front-end is hosted on Netlify: https://chic-travesseiro-7b7f19.netlify.app/

The back-end is a Dockerized Springboot REST API hosted on Azure App Services. 

It's also available as a docker image on Docker Hub https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/prokopchukdim/music-visualizer
